# INFOEPLRMA_MazeTask
This is the GitHub page for the project in the course Experimentation in Psychology, Linguistics & AI (INFOEPLRMA). 
The project was done by Naomi Oppeneer and Maike Sjollema.

This project investigated whether lexical (e.g., _zitten op_) and aspectual (e.g., _zitten te_) posture verbs in Dutch share a mental representation. This was analysed through the theoretical lens of structural priming. In particular, the maze task (a version of self-paced reading) was run offline through PsychoPy.

This GitHub page holds the stimuli, Python code for the maze task, and the Rstudio file for the data preparation and analysis.
