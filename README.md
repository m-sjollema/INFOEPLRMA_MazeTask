# INFOEPLRMA_MazeTask
This is the GitHub page for the project in the course Experimentation in Psychology, Linguistics & AI (INFOEPLRMA). 
The project was done by Naomi Oppeneer and Maike Sjollema.

For the project, we investigated whether lexical (e.g., _zitten op_) and aspectual (e.g., _zitten te_) posture verbs in Dutch share a mental representation. This was analysed through the theoretical lens of structural priming. In particular, the maze task (a version of self-paced reading) was run offline through PsychoPy.

This GitHub page holds the stimuli, Python code for the maze task, and the Rstudio file for the data preparation and analysis. 
In the folder MazeTask, there are three experiments written in Python containing the same Python code. However, as this experiment was done in a Latin square design, each experiment uses a different set of primes and targets. Hence, each experiment has their corresponding csv-file.
